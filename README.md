# Sales-Pitch

Hi, MegaToast here to bring you another FANtastic offer!

have you ever been slammed so hard into a wall that you were turned into soup 

inside your armour due to the shock of the blast?

Maybe you tripped over the hilt of Seurat's sword and broke your legs!

Well, that sort of occurance will be a thing of the past with Awesomedude1's 

amazing Dabura Gear!

This is because inside of each peice of Awesomedude1's Dabura Gear is a finely 

craft, hand woven padded layer which offers 5 INCHES of soft cushioning for those 

times when Shadow Everat tosses you off the top floor of Fury Tower!

Maybe you will still brake some bones, but at least you won't die!

I know from experience that it isn't fun to be killed in the heat of battle against 

a tough opponent...

That's why I bought Awesomedude1's Dabura Gear! 

No longer do I get spawn killed in Battlefield! Now, I'm the spawn killer!

Many more times than I could count, I've been dragged to the depths of the ocean by 

Bahamut... And those heavy 'Do-It-Yourself' gears don't help! 

Awesomedude1's gear is finely crafted from only the lightest of Dabura and Topaz 

pieces which weigh under a certain weight, after which they are 'De-massified' by a 

special trademarked technique, making Awesomedude1's Dabura Gear offer the highest 

mobility and allowing for increased endurance!

Speaking of the ocean's depths, did you know that Awesomedude1's Dabura Gear comes 

fully equipped with diving gear? No more worries of drowning while in Starry Town, 

or of taking a nasty plunge into the waters of the Sewer!

Awesomedude1's Dabura Gear is also electro-shock resistant! Those silly robots in 

the Factory won't know what hit 'em! The Iron Giant won't be more than a mere 

toaster to you!

And the best part about Awesomedude1's gear is that it can all be yours for the low 

low price of whatever he has it listed for!

That's right, Awesomedude1 isn't here to rip you off! All his gear is priced so 

low, that in fact, he takes a negative profit on almost every piece sold! That's 

how dedicated he is to the heroes of Serenity! There are no hidden fees, no scams, 

nothing but the low low prices and the amazing Dabura Gear!

So what are you waiting for!?

Buy some! Do it! NOW!!!
